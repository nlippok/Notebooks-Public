This GitHub repository provides a simulation tool as Supplementary Material to our paper entitled <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-47-7-1903" target="_blank">RF Properties of Circular-Ranging OCT Signals</a>. An interested reader will be able to generate CR signals as produced by a monotonically stepped frequency comb source in the RF domain. The simulation can be initated from an external server (see #2 below) or run directly on your computer (see #3 below).

1. Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/69HpwpK_YdQ" target="_blank">tutorial video</a>.
2. The two links below initiate a simulation based on Jupyter Notebook (Python) using an external server. Neither knowledge nor installation of Jupyter / Python is required. The server can be initiated from a computer, tablet or phone. Starting the server (based on <a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank">MyBinder</a>) for the first time can take up to 10 minutes. Occasionally the server has too much traffic. Please try again or try another time in this case.
3. The best method to run the simulation is to download and then launch the Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) from your computer within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
    1. All the files in the directory above (`*.ipynb`, `setup.png`) are required to run the simulation. To download the entire repository, simply download       the zip archive from this directory by clicking on `archive.zip` and selecting **Download** (right side).
    2. Running the Notebook on your computer requires the installation of Jupyter Notebook and Python. We recommend downloading the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual" target="_blank">Anaconda</a> package, which is easy and free.  
    3. To start the Notebook, open `notebook.ipynb` inside a Jupyter Notebook environment. Run the simulation by selecting **Kernel** and **Restart Kernel & Run All Cells** from the menu.
