This GitHub repository provides a simulation tool as Supplementary Material to our paper entitled <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-47-7-1903" target="_blank">RF Properties of Circular-Ranging OCT Signals</a>. An interested reader will be able to generate CR signals as produced by a monotonically stepped frequency comb source in the RF domain. The simulation can be initated from an external server (see #1 below) or run directly on your computer (see #3 below).

1. The two links below initiate a simulation based on Jupyter Notebook (Python) using an external server. Neither knowledge nor installation of Jupyter / Python is required. The server can be initiated from a computer, tablet or phone. Starting the server (based on <a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank">MyBinder</a>) for the first time can take up to 10 minutes. Occasionally the server has a lot of traffic. Please try again or another time in this case.
2. The best method to run the simulation is to download and then launch the Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) from your computer within a Jupyter Notebook environment.
    1. All files in this directory (`*.ipynb`, `setup.png`) are required to start the simulation. To download the entire repository, simply download the zip archive from this directory (`archive.zip`).
    2. Running the Notebook on your computer requires the installation of Jupyter Notebook and Python. We recommend downloading the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual" target="_blank">Anaconda</a> package, which is easy and free.  
    3. To start the Notebook, open `notebook.ipynb` inside a Jupyter Notebook environment. Run the simulation by selecting **Kernel** and **Restart Kernel & Run All Cells** from the menu.
