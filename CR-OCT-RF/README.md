This GitHub repository provides a simulation tool as Supplementary Material to our paper entitled *RF Properties of Circular-Ranging OCT Signals*. An interested reader will be able to generate and study CR signals as produced by a monotonically stepped frequency comb source in the RF domain.

* The link below initiates a self-running simulation based on Jupyter Notebook (Python3). No installation of Jupiter Notebook or Python nor prior knowledge of Jupyter / Pyton is required.
* Starting the server (based on <a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank">MyBinder</a>) for the first time could take up to 10 minutes. Please be patient.
* Optionally, the Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) can be downloaded from the directory above and run within a Jupyter environment. Note that all the files above (`*.ipynb`, `setup.png`) are required to run the simulation. Running the Notebook externally requires the installation of Jupyter Notebook and Python3. We recommend downloading <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual" target="_blank">Anaconda</a>, which is free.
