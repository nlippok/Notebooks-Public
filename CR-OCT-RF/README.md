This GitHub repository provides a simulation tool as Supplementary Material to our paper entitled *RF Properties of Circular-Ranging OCT Signals*. An interested reader will be able to generate and study CR signals as produced by a monotonically stepped frequency comb source in the RF domain.
* Watch <a href="https://youtu.be/69HpwpK_YdQ" target="_blank">introduction video</a>.
* The two links below initiate a simulation based on Jupyter Notebook (Python). Neither knowledge nor installation of Python / Jupyter is required. Starting the server (based on <a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank">MyBinder</a>) for the first time can take up to 10 minutes. Please be patient. Occasionally the <a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank">MyBinder</a> server is too busy. Please try again another time in this case.
* Alternatively, the Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) can be downloaded and run within a Jupyter environment. Note that all the files above (`*.ipynb`, `setup.png`) are required to run the simulation. Running the Notebook externally requires the installation of Jupyter Notebook and Python. We recommend downloading the <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual" target="_blank">Anaconda</a> package, which is free. To download the entire repository, go to the previous directory (<a href="https://github.com/nlippok/Notebooks-Public" target="_blank" <Notebooks-Public</a>) and download the CR-OCT-RF folder by clicking the Code botton (Download ZIP).
